**Project Overview: Data-Driven Insights on Global Sustainability**

**Introduction**

This project focuses on building a Data Warehouse (DW) and Business Intelligence (BI) system to analyze global sustainability data related to CO₂ emissions, water resources, land use, and biodiversity. The goal is to provide actionable insights for policymakers, NGOs, researchers, and environmental strategists.

**Business Case**

**Problem Statement**

Environmental data is often fragmented and dispersed, making it difficult to derive meaningful insights for sustainability efforts.
Lack of centralized platforms that can help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

**Motivation**

Addressing urgent climate and environmental challenges such as emissions, biodiversity loss, and water scarcity.
Providing a structured data platform to support sustainable policymaking and resource allocation.

**Challenges**

Dispersed data sources from multiple global organizations.
Inconsistencies in datasets, requiring thorough cleaning and transformation.
Limited tools for meaningful insights, making it necessary to use BI techniques.

**Solution**

Developing a Data Warehouse (DW) that integrates multiple datasets.
Implementing Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards to visualize sustainability trends.
Enabling real-time analysis to support environmental decision-making.

**Stakeholders Benefiting**

Government Agencies, NGOs, Researchers, Environmental Strategists

**Tools Used**

Python for Data Cleaning and Transformation

MySQL based Data Warehouse

Excel for Prototype 

Power BI for visualisation

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

CO₂ Emissions Change

Threatened Species Rate

Water & Sanitation Disparities

Forest Cover Change
